# FND-02: Phase 2 Foundations Alignment

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: BLOCKER — must complete before Phase 3 implementation begins
**Scope**: Strengthen Phase 2 code and specs to align with `docs/FOUNDATIONS.md`
**Source**: Golden e2e test reports, Phase 2 alignment analysis

## Goal

Eliminate remaining architectural gaps where Phase 2 code and specs violate foundational principles — specifically: abstract float confidence scores in E14 spec, non-deterministic HashMap in E14 spec, missing GoalKind candidate emission for treatment acquisition, stale assumptions about premature `SellCommodity` wiring, undocumented feedback dampeners across Phase 2 systems, and missing debuggability APIs.

## Non-Goals

- Do not implement E14 (Perception & Beliefs) — this spec only fixes the E14 *spec document* to be determinism-safe.
- Do not add backward-compatibility shims (Principle 26).
- Do not restructure Phase 2 systems — only wire missing goal emissions and add inspection APIs.
- Do not implement full causal tracing UI — only the foundational query APIs.

---

## Section A — Strengthen E14 Spec (FND02-001)

**Ticket**: FND02-001
**Principles violated**: 3 (Concrete State Over Abstract Scores), determinism invariants (no floats, no HashMap)

### Problem

`specs/E14-perception-beliefs.md` line 35 specifies `known_facts: HashMap<FactId, PerceivedFact>` and line 41 specifies `confidence: f32`. Both violate project-wide determinism invariants:

- `HashMap` has non-deterministic iteration order — all authoritative state must use `BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet` (see CLAUDE.md Critical Invariants).
- `f32` is forbidden in authoritative state — all [0,1] or [0,1000] range values must use `Permille` (see CLAUDE.md Spec Drafting Rules, Principle 3).

Additionally, the E14 spec lacks the FND-01 Section H analysis (information-path, positive-feedback, concrete dampeners, stored vs derived) now required for all specs.

Finally, the E14/E16 boundary is underspecified. E14 must define the belief-side evidence pipeline that later loyalty and support systems consume, while the concrete replacement of `LoyalTo.strength: Permille` belongs to the social/institutional work rather than to the perception epic alone.

### Required Changes

**File**: `specs/E14-perception-beliefs.md`

1. **Replace `HashMap<FactId, PerceivedFact>` → `BTreeMap<FactId, PerceivedFact>`** in the Memory component specification.

2. **Replace `confidence: f32` → `confidence: Permille`** in the `PerceivedFact` struct specification. Document the scale: `Permille(1000)` = direct observation, degrading for indirect sources.

3. **Add FND-01 Section H analysis** to the spec:
   - Information-path analysis: How does each piece of information reach agents? (Trace: event → witness → belief store, or event → rumor → belief store with time-per-hop delay.)
   - Positive-feedback analysis: Identify amplifying loops in the perception/belief system.
   - Concrete dampeners: For each loop, specify the physical world mechanism that limits it.
   - Stored state vs. derived read-model list: Enumerate what is authoritative (belief stores, witness records) vs. derived (belief queries, staleness checks).

4. **Add an E14/E16 loyalty boundary requirement**: E14 must specify which concrete social evidence enters belief state (for example witnessed cooperation, fulfilled obligations, betrayals, and public records/reports), and it must forbid new belief APIs from depending on omniscient or scalar-loyalty shortcuts. The downstream social spec owns the concrete replacement of `LoyalTo.strength: Permille`.

5. **Require full OmniscientBeliefView replacement**: E14 must fully replace `OmniscientBeliefView` (not wrap it). After E14, no code path may use `OmniscientBeliefView`.

6. **Keep immediate downstream specs consistent**: Update E15 confidence language to `Permille` terminology and align planning docs so they do not assign the loyalty-model redesign to E14 alone.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] E14 spec contains no `HashMap` in authoritative state definitions.
- [ ] E14 spec contains no `f32` in authoritative state definitions.
- [ ] E14 spec includes complete FND-01 Section H analysis.
- [ ] E14 spec documents the E14/E16 belief-to-social boundary for later loyalty redesign.
- [ ] E14 spec requires full OmniscientBeliefView removal (not wrapping).

## Section B — Preserve `SellCommodity` Deferral Until S04 (FND02-002)

**Ticket**: FND02-002
**Principles violated**: 28 (Every New System Spec Must Declare Its Causal Hooks — completeness), 18 (Resource-Bounded Practical Reasoning Over Scripts)

### Problem

The original FND-02 assumption was stale. `GoalKind::SellCommodity` exists in `crates/worldwake-core/src/goal.rs`, but current Phase 2 architecture intentionally does not make it real yet:

- `crates/worldwake-ai/src/search.rs` explicitly treats `SellCommodity` as unsupported.
- `crates/worldwake-ai/src/candidate_generation.rs` contains regression coverage asserting deferred goal kinds like `SellCommodity` are not emitted.
- `specs/S04-merchant-selling-market-presence.md` defines the concrete architecture that makes seller-side selling valid: `SaleListing`, `staff_market`, listed-lot discovery, and removal of profile-inferred seller visibility.

Emitting `SellCommodity` in FND-02 would create a ranked but unsatisfiable goal and would strengthen the pre-S04 abstraction that S04 is meant to replace.

### Required Changes

**File**: `crates/worldwake-ai/src/candidate_generation.rs`

1. **Do not emit `SellCommodity` in FND-02**: Keep seller-side selling deferred until S04 introduces concrete seller-market state and satisfiable planning semantics.

2. **Strengthen the regression coverage**:
   - Prove `SellCommodity` is still not emitted even when an agent has `MerchandiseProfile`, local stock, a valid `home_market`, and remembered demand.
   - Preserve the existing regression that deferred goal kinds are not emitted.

3. **Preserve current enterprise behavior**:
   - `RestockCommodity` and `MoveCargo` remain the active enterprise goals in Phase 2 / FND-02.
   - `MerchandiseProfile` continues to express enterprise intent, not active sale visibility.

### Test

- Unit test: merchant with stock, `home_market`, and remembered demand still does not emit `SellCommodity` before S04.
- Unit test: deferred-goal regression still proves `SellCommodity` is not emitted.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `SellCommodity` remains deferred in FND-02.
- [ ] Regression coverage proves `SellCommodity` is not emitted even for merchants with stock, `home_market`, and demand memory.
- [ ] Existing deferred-goal regression still passes.
- [ ] No partial seller-side market-presence behavior is introduced ahead of S04.

## Section C — Wire AcquireCommodity(Treatment) Goal Emission (FND02-003)

**Ticket**: FND02-003
**Principles violated**: 28 (Completeness), 18 (Resource-Bounded Practical Reasoning Over Scripts)

### Problem

Treatment acquisition is not wired in candidate generation. When an agent with healing capability (or any agent aware of wounded agents) lacks medicine/treatment commodities, they cannot autonomously decide to acquire them.

### Required Changes

**File**: `crates/worldwake-ai/src/candidate_generation.rs`

1. **Add treatment-acquisition emission**: When an agent knows of a wounded entity (self or other) and lacks the commodity needed for treatment, emit `GoalKind::AcquireCommodity { commodity, purpose: CommodityPurpose::Treatment }`.

2. **Emission conditions**:
   - Agent or a co-located entity has active wounds (from `WoundTracker` or belief view).
   - Agent does not currently hold sufficient treatment commodity.
   - A treatment commodity exists in the recipe/item system.
   - Evidence: the wounded entity.

3. **Self-treatment priority**: When the wounded entity is the agent itself, priority should be elevated (pain/danger pressure from wounds feeds into this naturally through existing pressure derivation).

### Test

- Golden e2e test proving medicine-seeking behavior: wounded agent or healer emits AcquireCommodity(Treatment) candidate.
- Unit test: unwounded agent with no wounded co-located entities does not emit treatment candidates.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `AcquireCommodity` with `CommodityPurpose::Treatment` emitted when conditions met.
- [ ] No treatment candidates when no wounds present.
- [ ] Golden e2e test passes.

## Section D — Feedback Dampening Audit (FND02-004)

**Ticket**: FND02-004
**Principles violated**: 10 (Every Positive Feedback Loop Needs a Physical Dampener)

### Problem

No systematic audit has been performed on Phase 2 systems for amplifying feedback loops. Each system was implemented independently; cross-system amplification patterns may exist undocumented and undamped.

### Required Changes

**Scope**: Analysis and documentation, plus code fixes for any undamped loops found.

1. **Audit each Phase 2 system for amplifying loops**:

   **Needs/Metabolism** (`crates/worldwake-systems/src/needs.rs`, `needs_actions.rs`):
   - Identify: Does need satisfaction create conditions that accelerate need growth? (e.g., eating → energy → more activity → faster hunger)
   - Document dampeners: resource depletion (food consumed is gone), action duration (eating takes time), capacity limits.

   **Production** (`crates/worldwake-systems/src/production.rs`, `production_actions.rs`):
   - Identify: Does production create conditions that accelerate further production? (e.g., crafting tools → faster crafting → more tools)
   - Document dampeners: raw material depletion, workstation occupancy, action duration, storage/load limits.

   **Trade** (`crates/worldwake-systems/src/trade.rs`, `trade_actions.rs`):
   - Identify: Does successful trade create conditions for more trade? (e.g., profit → buy more → sell more → more profit)
   - Document dampeners: inventory limits, travel time between markets, demand saturation (DemandMemory aging), coin/commodity conservation.

   **Combat** (`crates/worldwake-systems/src/combat.rs`):
   - Identify: Does combat create conditions for more combat? (e.g., wounds → vulnerability → more attacks → more wounds)
   - Document dampeners: wound incapacitation, death, flight responses, weapon/energy depletion.

   **AI Enterprise** (`crates/worldwake-ai/src/enterprise.rs`):
   - Identify: Does enterprise goal generation create runaway goal spirals?
   - Document dampeners: planning budget limits, blocked intent memory, goal switching margins.

2. **Document findings** in a new file: `docs/dampening-audit-phase2.md`

3. **Fix any undamped loops**: If the audit reveals loops with no physical dampener (only numerical clamps), add concrete dampening mechanisms.

4. **Add gate note**: All Phase 3+ specs must include their own Section H dampening analysis before implementation.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All five Phase 2 system domains audited for amplifying loops.
- [ ] Each identified loop has a documented physical dampener.
- [ ] No loops rely solely on numerical clamps (`min`, `max`, `clamp`) as dampeners.
- [ ] `docs/dampening-audit-phase2.md` created with audit results.
- [ ] Any undamped loops fixed with concrete world mechanisms.

## Section E — Debuggability Foundation (FND02-005)

**Ticket**: FND02-005
**Principles violated**: 27 (Debuggability Is a Product Feature)

### Problem

No structured causal inspection APIs exist. The simulation produces emergent behavior but provides no programmatic way to answer "why did this agent do that?" or "what caused this event?" These are core debuggability requirements per Principle 27.

### Required Changes

1. **Add `explain_goal()` to AI crate**:

   **File**: New file `crates/worldwake-ai/src/goal_explanation.rs`

   ```rust
   pub struct GoalExplanation {
       pub goal: GoalKind,
       pub priority_class: PriorityClass,
       pub motive_value: Permille,
       pub evidence_entities: Vec<EntityId>,
       pub evidence_places: Vec<EntityId>,
       pub competing_goals: Vec<(GoalKind, PriorityClass, Permille)>,
   }

   pub fn explain_goal(
       view: &dyn BeliefView,
       agent: EntityId,
       goal: &GoalKind,
       blocked: &BlockedIntentMemory,
       recipes: &RecipeRegistry,
       current_tick: Tick,
   ) -> Option<GoalExplanation>;
   ```

   This is a **derived read-model** (Principle 25) — it recomputes the ranking for a specific goal and returns the explanation. It does not store any state.

2. **Add `trace_event_cause()` to sim crate**:

   **File**: New file `crates/worldwake-sim/src/event_trace.rs`

   ```rust
   pub fn trace_event_cause(
       event_log: &EventLog,
       event_id: EventId,
   ) -> Vec<EventId>;
   ```

   Walks the `CauseRef` chain from the given event backwards through the event log, returning the ordered causal ancestry. This is a **derived read-model** — it traverses existing event log data without storing anything new.

3. **Wire into `lib.rs`** for both crates.

### Test

- Unit test for `explain_goal()`: Create an agent with hunger pressure, verify explanation includes the correct goal kind, priority class, and evidence.
- Unit test for `trace_event_cause()`: Create a chain of 3+ causally linked events, verify the trace returns the correct ancestry in order.
- Edge case: `trace_event_cause()` on an event with no cause returns empty vec.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `explain_goal()` function exists in `worldwake-ai` and returns structured explanation.
- [ ] `trace_event_cause()` function exists in `worldwake-sim` and returns causal ancestry.
- [ ] Both are derived read-models (no stored state).
- [ ] Unit tests for both APIs pass.
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace` passes.

## Section F — DRAFT Promotion to Formal Specs

**Ticket**: FND02-006

### Problem

Six DRAFT specs in `specs/` represent valuable architectural work from Phase 2 analysis that has not been formally integrated into the implementation order. They need formal spec numbers, dependency declarations, and phase placement.

### Required Changes

1. **Rename files** (preserving git history via `git mv`):

   | Current | New |
   |---------|-----|
   | `specs/DRAFT-production-output-ownership-claims.md` | `specs/S01-production-output-ownership-claims.md` |
   | `specs/DRAFT-goal-decision-policy-unification.md` | `specs/S02-goal-decision-policy-unification.md` |
   | `specs/DRAFT-planner-target-identity-and-affordance-binding.md` | `specs/S03-planner-target-identity-and-affordance-binding.md` |
   | `specs/DRAFT-merchant-selling-market-presence.md` | `specs/S04-merchant-selling-market-presence.md` |
   | `specs/DRAFT-merchant-stock-storage-and-stalls.md` | `specs/S05-merchant-stock-storage-and-stalls.md` |
   | `specs/DRAFT-commodity-opportunity-valuation.md` | `specs/S06-commodity-opportunity-valuation.md` |

2. **Each spec must include** (add if missing):
   - FND-01 Section H analysis (information-path, feedback loops, dampeners, stored vs derived).
   - Explicit dependency declarations.
   - Phase placement in the implementation order.

3. **Integration into `specs/IMPLEMENTATION-ORDER.md`**:
   - S01, S02, S03 → Phase 3, Step 10 (parallel after E14)
   - S04, S05, S06 → Phase 4+, Step 14 (economy deepening after E22)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No files matching `specs/DRAFT-*.md` exist.
- [ ] Six files `specs/S01-*.md` through `specs/S06-*.md` exist.
- [ ] Each S-spec has dependency and phase placement declarations.
- [ ] All S-specs appear in `specs/IMPLEMENTATION-ORDER.md`.

## Implementation Order

1. **FND02-001** (Section A): Fix E14 spec — spec-only change, no code
2. **FND02-004** (Section D): Dampening audit — analysis + documentation + possible code fixes
3. **FND02-002** (Section B): Preserve `SellCommodity` deferral until S04 — ticket correction + regression coverage
4. **FND02-003** (Section C): Wire AcquireCommodity(Treatment) — code change in candidate_generation.rs
5. **FND02-005** (Section E): Debuggability APIs — new files in ai and sim crates
6. **FND02-006** (Section F): DRAFT promotion — file renames + spec amendments

Tickets 1 and 4 are spec/analysis work and can be parallelized.
Tickets 2, 3, and 5 are code work and can be parallelized.
Ticket 6 (DRAFT promotion file renames) is done as part of this FND-02 creation.

## FND-02 Gate Criteria

Before proceeding to Phase 3 (E14 implementation):

- [ ] E14 spec is determinism-safe (no `f32`, no `HashMap` in authoritative state)
- [ ] Phase 2 / FND-02 goal candidate coverage is complete for currently supported, satisfiable goal variants; `SellCommodity` remains explicitly deferred to S04
- [ ] Dampening audit documented in `docs/dampening-audit-phase2.md`
- [ ] `explain_goal()` and `trace_event_cause()` APIs exist and tested
- [ ] 6 DRAFTs promoted to S01-S06 and integrated into implementation order
- [ ] `cargo test --workspace` passes

## Cross-References

- `docs/FOUNDATIONS.md` — Principles 3, 10, 18, 25, 26, 27, 28
- `archive/specs/FND-01-phase1-foundations-alignment.md` — predecessor spec, pattern reference
- `specs/E14-perception-beliefs.md` — Section A target

## Tests Summary

| Ticket | Test | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| FND02-001 | spec review | E14 spec contains no f32 or HashMap in authoritative state |
| FND02-002 | unit | `SellCommodity` remains deferred before S04 even for merchants with stock, `home_market`, and demand memory |

| FND02-005 | unit tests | explain_goal returns structured explanation; trace_event_cause returns causal ancestry |
| FND02-006 | file listing | No DRAFT-*.md files; S01-S06 exist and appear in IMPLEMENTATION-ORDER.md |

## Outcome

- Completion date: 2026-03-14
- What actually changed:
  - `specs/E14-perception-beliefs.md` was updated to use `BTreeMap` and `Permille`, add the Section H foundations analysis, define the E14/E16 social-evidence boundary, and require full `OmniscientBeliefView` replacement.
  - `specs/E15-rumor-witness-discovery.md` now uses `Permille` confidence language consistent with E14.
  - `crates/worldwake-ai/src/candidate_generation.rs` preserves `SellCommodity` deferral until S04, adds treatment-oriented `AcquireCommodity` emission, and carries regression coverage for both behaviors.
  - `docs/dampening-audit-phase2.md` documents the implemented Phase 2 amplifying loops and their concrete dampeners.
  - `crates/worldwake-ai/src/goal_explanation.rs` adds `GoalExplanation` and `explain_goal()` coverage.
  - `trace_event_cause()` exists on `worldwake_core::EventLog`, with CLI/tests updated to use the ancestry-oriented API.
- Deviations from original plan:
  - The causal-trace API landed on the existing core event-log type instead of a new `worldwake-sim` module because the authoritative event log already lives in `worldwake-core`.
  - `explain_goal()` takes `&UtilityProfile` and returns motive values as `u32`, matching the current ranking pipeline instead of the earlier draft signature.
- Verification results:
  - FND-02 completion artifacts are present in-tree: updated E14/E15 specs, `docs/dampening-audit-phase2.md`, `crates/worldwake-ai/src/goal_explanation.rs`, `EventLog::trace_event_cause()`, and treatment/deferred-sell candidate coverage in `candidate_generation.rs`.
  - Implementation order updated alongside archival so the roadmap no longer treats FND-02 as an active gate spec.
